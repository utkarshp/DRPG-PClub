==========

Creating an app to convert images taken by an android phone to a machine readable text using OCR.
We intend to use online OCR tools for this conversion like i2ocr. Code to use i2OCR should be ready by 9th Jan 2013 11:59 PM
For recognizing mathematical formulae and processing them, we intend to use gImage editor: a freeware(GNU) licensed
software on remote server.
