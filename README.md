Creating an app to convert images taken by an android phone to a machine readable text using OCR.
We intend to use online OCR tools for this conversion like i2ocr. Code to use i2OCR should be ready by 9th Jan 2013 11:59 PM
For recognizing mathematical formulae and processing them, we intend to use gImage editor: a freeware(GNU) licensed software on remote server. gImage editor uses Tesseract as the OCR engine. We intend to alter the code so as to enable it to be able to read mathematical formulae and scientific notation as well.
